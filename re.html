                      <h2>Months</h2>
        
                      <p>There are two month counting systems prevalant in India.
                      </p><p>1.Amanta or mukhya mana system – a month begins after a new moon, mostly followed in the southern states.
                      </p><p>2.Purnimanta or gauna mana system – a month begins after  full moon, Panchanga, followed more in the North.
                      </p><p>Quite understandably, no matter which of the above systems are used, the Festival dates should be same – ie, Diwali date is same.
                      
                      </p><p>The 6 Sesasons and 12 months are:
                      </p><p>Vasanta - Chaitra 
                      </p><p>Vasanta - Vishaka
                      </p><p>Grishma - Jyeshta
                      </p><p>Grishma - Ashada
                      </p><p>Varsha - Shravana
                      </p><p>Varsha - Bhadrapadha
                      </p><p>Sharada - Aswija
                      </p><p>Sharada - Kartika
                      </p><p>Hemanta - Margashira
                      </p><p>Hemanta - Pushya
                      </p><p>Shishira - Magha
                      </p><p>Shishira - Phalguna
                      </p>
                      <h3>Adhika Masam</h3>
                      <p>An adhika masa occurs once every two or three years (meaning, with a gap of one or two years without adhika masas). Since the tithi calendar is based on the phases of the moon, the twelve lunar months take 354 days, 8 hours and 34.28 seconds. This creates a difference of 10 days, 21 hours and 35.16 seconds from the actual solar year (365 days, 6 hours, 9.54 seconds)
                      </p><p>When the accumulated difference exceeds 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.865 seconds, an adjustment is made with a extra month (Adhika Maas), which carries the name of the previous or the next month, depending on the proximity of the month. Normally, seven extra months occur in 19 years.
                      </p><p>When there is no solar ingress in a lunar month, ie, the sun does not at all transit into any new rashi but simply keeps moving within a rashi in a lunar month (i.e. before a new moon), then that lunar month will be named according to the first upcoming transit. It will also take the epithet of adhika or “extra”. For example, if a lunar month elapsed without a solar transit and the next transit is into Mesha, then this month without transit is labeled adhika Chaitra. The next month will be labeled according to its transit as usual and will get the epithet nija (“original”) or shuddha (“clean”).
                      </p>
                      <h3>Kshaya Masam</h3>
                      <p>If the sun transits into two rashis within a lunar month, then the month will have to be labeled by both transits and will take the epithet kshaya or “loss”. There is considered to be a “loss” because: if the sun had transited into only one raashi in a lunar month as is usual, there would have been two separate months labeled by the two transits in question; but now there is only one month labeled by both transits!
                      </p><p>For example, if the sun transits into Mesha and Vrishabha in a lunar month, then it will be called Chaitra-Vaishaakha kshaya. There will be no separate months labeled Chaitra and Vaishakha.
                      </p><p>A kshaya masa occurs very rarely. Known gaps between occurrence of kshaya masas are 19 and 141 years. The last was in 1983. Jan-15 through Feb-12 were Pausha-Magha kshaya. Feb-13 onwards was (adhika) Phalguna.
                      </p>

                In ancient days Yogis (saints) interact directly with God, according to that, 
                they have given information related to our Indian Kalachakra (time-cycle) 
                in relation to Lord Brahma. Below is the Indian Kalachakra (time-cycle):
        
            </p><p>60 years = Shashti Poorthi
            </p><p>432,000 years = Kali Yuga

            </p><p>1,296,000 years = Treta Yuga
            </p><p>1,728,000 years = Satya Yuga
            </p><p>4,320,000 years = Chatur Yuga (Total 4 Yuga)
            </p><p>71 Chatur Yuga = Manvantara
            </p><p>1,000 Chatur Yuga = Kalpa a.k.a. Brahma day (= 14 Manvantara + 15 Manvantara-sandhya)
            </p><p>Kalpa + Pralaya = Brahma Day (day + night)
            </p><p>30 Brahma Days = Brahma month
            </p><p>12 Brahma months = Brahma year
            </p><p>100 Brahma years = Brahma lifespan a.k.a. 
            </p><p>Maha-kalpa of 311.04 trillion years (followed by Maha-pralaya of equal length)
