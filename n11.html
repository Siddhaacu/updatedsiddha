                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  Males born in Purva Phalguni Nakshatra tend to have a very prosperous career in whichever field they choose to take. They will have a successful life in terms of their profession but there are also chances where they will have to face some kind of mental disturbance because of various issues. They love their independence and freedom, and will not take lightly on those who try to take their freedom away from them. Males of this nakshatra are very soft-spoken and they possess the power of intuition which they will use for the benefit of others. They also love to travel.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>
                  Purva Phalguni males do not like to work under someone else, so jobs, where they have to answer to their superiors, will not be the best choice of profession for them. Because of this nature, their hard work will mostly be unappreciated by their superiors and they will be unliked by them, which will ultimately result in them not getting promotions and a delay in their success. They are more prone to having enemies which they are not aware of, causing them difficulties in their career, even when these males are very honest human beings and will never try to gain success by sacrificing someone else. Males of this nakshatra are very intelligent, hence even if someone tries to cheat or plot against them, they will easily overcome it. They are more likely to venture into different jobs until the age of 45 and after that, they will be fairly satisfied with their place. Chances are that people will try to cheat them financially, so they should avoid lending money to others.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility male</h4>

They are more likely to live away from their birthplace and their family.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Health male</h4>
                  Apart from very small illnesses such as dental issues, stomach problems, or in rare cases diabetes, they will lead a healthy life and will rarely have to worry about their health.

Because of their honesty, they will hardly perform any illegal activity or do something that might harm someone in any way. All these features make them a very likeable person. But something that they should think of changing is their desire to gloat about their success around people who lack.
