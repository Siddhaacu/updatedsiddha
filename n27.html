                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  The native of the Revati Nakshatra is pure-hearted, soft-spoken and sincere in his dealings, both in his personal and professional lives. Also, he knows the right thing to say at the right time, so he is unlikely to ever hurt anyone with his words or deeds. Because he leads an independent life, he can easily get hurt if someone tries to control his freedom. Though he does not trust anyone blindly, once he has given them his trust after great deliberation, he tends to get attached to those people. This native is very ambitious, and even a slight setback can make him depressed.

He also has a strong will-power and overcomes difficult obstacles to reach his goals. The native will be of a scientific bent of mind, will be interested in doing historical research, especially in cultures, including astrology and astronomy. His rewards are unlikely to be in proportion with his hard-work till the age of 50, after which he can expect to lead a stable and comfortable life.
