                <P align="center"><h3>Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra</h3>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  The natives of this Nakshatra keep an equal relationship with high and low people regardless of the status of the person. They are blessed with an unblotted heart and thus do not like to give trouble to others. The only drawback noticed in this native in the behavioural field is that temper is always on the tip of their nose. However, such a short-temper is not permanent. They do not hesitate to make sacrifices, especially for those who love them. But once they are hurt, then their fiery anger can make anyone tremble with fear. A man of learning, he possesses great wisdom and is also a great orator. He is capable of overcoming any obstacles in his path to reach the very top of his profession. This native is highly sexually charged and is always on the lookout for the company of the opposite sex.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>
                  The male native of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra achieves great skills over many subjects simultaneously, even though he is not highly educationally qualified. In regard to education, they believe in self-education and generally prefer to get involved in fine arts. These natives usually aim for the top position and get a lot of applause from people around him. Such natives face many ups and downs in their career before settling down after the age of 42.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility male</h4>
                  The male native of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra holds his father in high esteem, and hardly derives any gains from him. In his childhood, he feels neglected and has to spend most of it away from home, such as in a boarding school. However, he will enjoy his married life to the hilt and will be fortunate to have a beautiful, loving, and caring wife. His children and grandchildren will also be very good for him. He will be divinely compensated after marriage for all the hardships he might have suffered before.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Health male</h4>
                  The health of the native of the Uttara Bhadrapada will be excellent, even though he does not pay too much attention to it. The reason for it being that he follows a good, active, and disciplined lifestyle. However, he can sometimes be a victim of paralysis attacks, stomach ailments, haemorrhoids, or hernia.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics female</h4>
                  The female native of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra has been observed who ushers wealth to her family, that is the reason why she is known as ‘Lakshmi’, the goddess of wealth. She is well-behaved, respects elders, and makes an excellent housewife. She is flexible and can adapt to any circumstances. She remains impartial and stands up courageously for what is right.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession female</h4>
                  The female native of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra not only earns a lot of wealth in her career but also gains a lot of popularity. At least within her own company. She will, however, have to travel a lot as a part of her job, although she is not very keen on being on the move all the time.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility female</h4>
                  The female natives of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra are as popular at home as they are in their profession, and bring a lot of glory and fortune to her family.
