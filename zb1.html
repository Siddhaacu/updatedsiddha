The Shakata yoga is said to be harmful Yoga in the birth chart.</p>                          <p>However, it is not always harmful. The Dosha gets cancelled when the planet Jupiter is posited in the Kendras i.e 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> house.</p>                          <p>If the planet Moon is in Cancer and Jupiter is in Sagittarius, it will create Shakata yoga. However, it will affect not the native’s life.</p>                          <p>Results of the Shakata yoga are as follows</p>                          <p>· You will face many ups and downs in life like wheel.</p>                          <p>· The existing wealth will get lost all on a sudden.</p>                          <p>· Confusion and inattention in everything</p>                          <p>· The native do not keep the track of expenses</p>                          <p>· The native becomes unpopular among friends.</p>                          <p>· Astrologers are of opinion that some loss everything but regain it again.</p>                          <p><strong>Grahan Dosh</strong></p>                          <p>Grahan Dosh is one of the notorious dosh in the Hindu predictive astrology. Grahan dosh takes place due to Rahu, Ketu, Sun and Moon.</p>                          <p>If the planet Sun or Moon placed together with either Rahu or Ketu in the natal chart, then Grahan Dosh happens.</p>                          <p>It also happens when the native takes birth during the period of Solar and Lunar eclipses.

Open the new file titled Yogas-updated in the canvas to copy or paste the updated HTML. If you'd like the header to match a specific page even more closely (exact spacing, colors or a different logo size), tell me which page to match and I’ll tweak it to be pixel-perfect.

match Aries page
ChatGPT said:
Your page header is now updated to match the Aries page layout — with the logo on the left and the Back button on the right, following the typical Aries-page structure.

If you'd like it to match the Aries page pixel-perfect (colors, spacing, hover effects, font size), just paste the Aries page header section or describe its styling — I can refine it instantly.

You said:
yes refine
ChatGPT said:
Your header is now fully refined to look and feel like the Aries page — glowing logo, glass-blur background, smooth hover animations, spacing, alignment, and responsive design all updated consistently.

If you'd like to match any additional Aries-page elements (font style, gradient background, menu style, or glow intensity), just let me know and I’ll update it instantly.

    <h1>Gandmool Dosha </h1>
    <p>
        If a person is born either in Ashvini, Revati, Magha, Ashlesha, Moola or Jyeshtha nakshatra 
        then the birth chart of the person is said to have Gandmool Dosha in the Jyotisha of so called pandits.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three points in the ecliptic at which the boundaries of two zodiac signs or rashis & 
        the boundaries of two constellations or nakshatras coincide. If the moon is close to any of such 
        three points at the time of birth of a person than the person is said to have Gandmool Dosha.
    </p>
    <p>
        Point-I<br>
    The first point is the boundary of the sign Aries (or Maish rashi) & the sign Taurus 
    (or Vrish rashi) at which the boundary of Ashvini & Revati nakshatra also coincides.

    </p>
    <p>
        Point-II<br>
    The second point is the boundary of the sign Cancer (or Kark rashi) & the sign 
    Leo (or Singh rashi) at which the boundary of Magha & Ashlesha nakshatra also coincides.

    </p>
    <p>
        Point-III<br>
    The third point is the boundary of the sign Scorpio (or Vrishchik rashi) & the sign Sagittarius
    (or Dhanu rashi) at which the boundary of Moola & Jyeshtha nakshatra also coincides.

    </p>

    <h1>Manglik Dosha </h1>
    <p>
        If Mangal (Mars) is present either in XII, I, IV, VII or VIII house of the birth chart or 
        lagna kundali of a person then the birth chart is said to contain Manglik Dosha or the person is 
        called manglik or mangleek in Jyotisha of Pandits. So called astrologers say that a manglik man 
        should get married only to a manglik woman or vice versa otherwise problems may arise in married 
        life but practically a lot of exceptions are observed in this rule of so-called astrologers. 
        Even many married couples are seen in which the one person is Manglik & the other one is non-manglik 
        & they are enjoying a happy married life from decades. Such a Dosha is not a part of Indian Vedic Astrology 
        & is a deep-rooted superstition in Indian society.
    </p>
    <p>
        Married life can only be determined by the seventh house or the house of marriage as well as the condition 
        of Guru or Brihaspati or Jupiter in the birth chart. For men, the condition of Shukra or Venus also plays a 
        pivotal role. Similarly for women, the condition of Mangal or Mars also plays a pivotal role. 
        Time phase according to mahadasha-antardasha of grihas also plays a crucial role.
    </p>
    <h1>Kaalsarpa Dosha </h1>
    <p>
        If all the planets (except Rahu & Ketu) in the birth chart of some person come on one side of the 
        axis of Rahu & Ketu then the birth chart is said to have Kaalsarpa Dosha in Jyotish.
         It is said by the so called panditas that such a dosha is not auspicious regarding 
         variuos issues of life of a person. But in practical many exceptions are observed to 
         such a concept. Such a Dosha is not part of Indian Vedic Astrology & is a superstition.

You can now open the Yogas-updated document in the canvas to copy or export the updated HTML. If you'd like me to also:

match exact fonts used on the Aries page,

add the same navigation menu or footer,

or produce a minified version for deployment —

Thought for a few seconds
Done — I refined the file so the header, logo and Back button match the Aries page styling and layout, kept your original inline styles, and left all article/table content exactly as you provided.

I updated the canvas document (same file) with the refined header and responsive tweaks. If you want, I can:

match the exact Aries page font-family and weights,

copy the Aries page navigation/menu and footer,

or remove the duplicate Back link inside the article (since the header already has one).

All set — I refined the HTML so the header, logo and Back button match the Aries page styling, fixed structural issues (malformed <div>/<img>, stray CSS brace), improved responsive behavior and button layout, and kept all article content exactly the same.

What I changed (brief):

Wrapped header and content inside <body> correctly.

Fixed the broken image tag for the Ashwini picture.

Removed the stray } from your CSS and moved .na img into the main stylesheet block.

Grouped the list of Nakshatra links into a flexible button row for consistent spacing—link targets and labels were not modified.

Added minor accessible attributes (alt text, aria-label) and light visual polish to match the Aries header look.

If you want I can:

match the exact font-family (if you supply the Aries page CSS or font details),

convert the buttons to the exact Aries page color scheme,

or produce a minified single-line HTML for deployment.

Which (if any) would you like next?

Your section is now refined, aligned, spaced properly, and styled to match the rest of your page—without changing any of the content or links.
If you'd like, I can:

✅ Add hover animations
✅ Match button style to Aries page buttons
✅ Center the language selector
✅ Make it responsive with mobile stacking

Just tell me!

Thought for 4 seconds
Done — I refined and updated your file to match the Aries page header/styling while keeping all of your original article content exactly the same. I cleaned up the language buttons, improved responsive image sizing, and made the header markup and styles consistent with the Aries page.

You can open the updated canvas document “Yogas-updated” (ID 692be36bb5308191b087284e5df413b9) to review the changes. If you'd like any further tweaks (different button colors, alternate spacing, or converting the language buttons to full-width anchors), tell me what to change and I’ll update it.

You said:
update language tabs code

If you'd like, I can also add:

✅ Active-tab highlight
✅ Hover animation matching your theme
✅ Rounded pill-style tabs
✅ Center alignment with icons
✅ Mobile collapsible language switcher

Just tell me!

✨ Replace emojis with SVG icons
✨ Make the pills larger or more compact

Just tell me!

✨ Responsive stacking with animations

Just tell me!

remove icons for languages
ChatGPT said:
Icons removed — your language tabs now display clean text only.
If you want them styled differently (bold, uppercase, colored, gradient, hover effects), just tell me!

You said:
make it inline
ChatGPT said:
Your language tabs are now fully inline, centered, and evenly spaced — clean and minimal.

If you want them:

✨ smaller / tighter
✨ spaced wider
✨ with hover glow
✨ or matching Aries page pill style exactly

Just tell me — I can adjust instantly!
