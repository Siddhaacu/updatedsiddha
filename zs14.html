      <h1>Gandmool Dosha </h1>
    <p>
        If a person is born either in Ashvini, Revati, Magha, Ashlesha, Moola or Jyeshtha nakshatra 
        then the birth chart of the person is said to have Gandmool Dosha in the Jyotisha of so called pandits.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three points in the ecliptic at which the boundaries of two zodiac signs or rashis & 
        the boundaries of two constellations or nakshatras coincide. If the moon is close to any of such 
        three points at the time of birth of a person than the person is said to have Gandmool Dosha.
    </p>
    <p>
        Point-I<br>
    The first point is the boundary of the sign Aries (or Maish rashi) & the sign Taurus 
    (or Vrish rashi) at which the boundary of Ashvini & Revati nakshatra also coincides.

    </p>
    <p>
        Point-II<br>
    The second point is the boundary of the sign Cancer (or Kark rashi) & the sign 
    Leo (or Singh rashi) at which the boundary of Magha & Ashlesha nakshatra also coincides.

    </p>
    <p>
        Point-III<br>
    The third point is the boundary of the sign Scorpio (or Vrishchik rashi) & the sign Sagittarius
    (or Dhanu rashi) at which the boundary of Moola & Jyeshtha nakshatra also coincides.

    </p>

    <h1>Manglik Dosha </h1>
    <p>
        If Mangal (Mars) is present either in XII, I, IV, VII or VIII house of the birth chart or 
        lagna kundali of a person then the birth chart is said to contain Manglik Dosha or the person is 
        called manglik or mangleek in Jyotisha of Pandits. So called astrologers say that a manglik man 
        should get married only to a manglik woman or vice versa otherwise problems may arise in married 
        life but practically a lot of exceptions are observed in this rule of so-called astrologers. 
        Even many married couples are seen in which the one person is Manglik & the other one is non-manglik 
        & they are enjoying a happy married life from decades. Such a Dosha is not a part of Indian Vedic Astrology 
        & is a deep-rooted superstition in Indian society.
    </p>
    <p>
        Married life can only be determined by the seventh house or the house of marriage as well as the condition 
        of Guru or Brihaspati or Jupiter in the birth chart. For men, the condition of Shukra or Venus also plays a 
        pivotal role. Similarly for women, the condition of Mangal or Mars also plays a pivotal role. 
        Time phase according to mahadasha-antardasha of grihas also plays a crucial role.
    </p>
    <h1>Kaalsarpa Dosha </h1>
    <p>
        If all the planets (except Rahu & Ketu) in the birth chart of some person come on one side of the 
        axis of Rahu & Ketu then the birth chart is said to have Kaalsarpa Dosha in Jyotish.
         It is said by the so called panditas that such a dosha is not auspicious regarding 
         variuos issues of life of a person. But in practical many exceptions are observed to 
         such a concept. Such a Dosha is not part of Indian Vedic Astrology & is a superstition.
