                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                      Male belonging to this nakshatra is the kind to doubt every action, 
                        and that too is for a legitimate reason as he had previously been cheated 
                        on by people close to him. Trust is something he does not do very easily 
                        and that is for his own good. Although, even if he has been conned by the 
                        people around him, he does not directly cut them off from his life but 
                        rather acts nice but wary around them. He is someone who is always 
                        invested in a conversation and is paying attention to every word 
                        that is being spoken and is expecting the same from others. 
                        Mrigashira male doesn’t like to be around people who are judgemental or
                         people he finds to be dishonest. However, males of this nakshatra may not 
                         be as truthful to themselves as they think they are, as they are someone 
                         who is different from the person they project themselves to be to the 
                         world.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>

                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility male</h4>
                  Although there will be immense love between him and his spouse, there will always be animosity in the relationship due to petty reasons and differences in opinion. The reason for most of the conflicts between him and his wife will be because one or the other has a higher profession, which will cause an inferiority complex among them.
