                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  Males born in Punarvasu Nakshatra are believed to be very spiritual and religious. They tend to have a good nature and behaviour when they are young, but as they grow up, they slowly start adopting a more crass and arrogant behaviour. As they become an adult, they slowly become less likeable, and because of this, being friends with them can be a little stress-inducing. They can sometimes crave for something they cannot have, but they can’t be called materialistic as they are generally satisfied with what they already have. Something that is non-negotiable for them is illegal activities, and neither would they do it themselves nor would they allow someone close to them to do it. Along with that, they can be very generous and helpful to others.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>
                  Punarvasu male can not work in any business where he will have to partner up with someone as he is a lone wolf, hence why he won’t be able to gain success in the field of business. Other than that, they will gain success in being a teacher or a stage performer being the most suitable for them. Till the age of 32, they should become more careful when making important decisions because of unfavourable stars. Because of their honesty, success in business and making wealth is very hard for them.
