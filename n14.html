                <P align="center"><h3>Chitra Nakshatra</h3>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  The male born in Chitra Nakshatra is a nature lover. These people are also very intelligent and use the trait to explore things that can give them profit of any kind. The male likes to be ahead of everyone else and, hence, never misses the opportunity to try something new for himself. His suggestions and ideas are well-thought, thus winning his praises both in his personal and professional life. As the person is artistic, he is able to make a good first impression on others, especially on the opposite gender. The male native is a good partner and cares for even the smallest need of each and everyone around him. However, when life is not treating him well, he may get rude at even the ones close to him.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>
                  As far as the profession goes, the male born in Chitra Nakshatra is very hardworking but yet has to struggle till the age of 32 to find success for himself. However, once he crosses this age, he will find success in multiple endeavours. In fact, the native, after crossing the age of 33, will see himself getting rewards from unexpected quarters and that too without striving too much. The best professions for the male born in the Chitra Nakshatra are architecture, engineering, pilot and anything related to travelling. If in business, the native will earn well in a partnership or even if he works with his parents.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility male</h4>
                  The male native born in the Chitra Nakshatra is more compatible with his siblings than anyone else. When it comes to his wife, the native is quite suspicious by nature, which may become the reason for stiffness in the relationship of the couple. Though the relationship will be stable, there will be frequent friction with his spouse. It is to his credit that all through life he shoulders a lot of responsibilities and yet gets criticised for them without complaining.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Health male</h4>
                  The male native born in the Chitra Nakshatra may have to deal with major health problems after the age of 25. This is because he doesn't take much care of his heath. Problems in the kidney and bladder are quite common for people born in this Nakshatra.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics female</h4>
                  The female born in Chitra Nakshatra is too fond of her freedom. She is of a forward nature and tired of being told what she should be doing and what she shouldn't. However, her craving for freedom has less authenticity as she usually enjoys the freedom she desires only after the age of 25. However, once she has her freedom, she needs to be careful of falling prey to sinful activities, as females born in Chitra Nakshatra are more prone to getting indulged in sinful deeds. The situation can be countered by ensuring that you make friends carefully. Talking about friends, the woman here may have very few friends but all of them will be very helpful.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession female</h4>
                  As far as the profession goes, the female native born in the Chitra Nakshatra does good in medical-related fields such as doctor or nurse. Apart from this, the lady has favourable chances of becoming an actress or a model or an influencer too. Whatever the lady does, she does it with full dedication and is able to get the desired results out of it. Astrologers are of the opinion that the female born in the Chitra Nakshatra is very lucky for her husband too and should be made a part of it for professional prosperity.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility female</h4>
                  The female native born in the Chitra Nakshatra must ensure that her horoscope is matched well with the boy before she gets married to him. The matching if not done can lead to fatal worries for the couple going forward. Also, there are chances of sexual incompatibility between you and your spouse which can be rectified only if you both are open about it. The lady has to be more dedicated in the relationship if she wants it to work.
                  <br>
                  <h4> Health female</h4>
                  The female born in the Chitra Nakshatra, just like males, may have to deal with major health problems after the age of 25. This is because he doesn't take much care of his health. Problems in the kidney and bladder are quite common for people born in this Nakshatra.
                  <br>
