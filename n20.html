                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  The native of the Purvashada Nakshatra possesses great intelligence. These natives can be very impulsive and argumentative so that it is difficult for anyone to beat them in any debate. He has impressive convincing abilities and is bound to make a good salesman. He is always ready with advice, but never ready to take it from others. Another important point is that though he claims to be very courageous, he shies away from displaying or proving it. In fact, he is really not so courageous. However, if pushed to the limits by circumstances, he does act purposefully and the little courage that he does possess will get manifested. He does not take any decisions on his own, but if provoked by someone to dare to make a decision, he will take it without thinking about the pros and cons, which more often than not harm him.
