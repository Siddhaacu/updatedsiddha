                <P align="center"><h3>Purvashadha Nakshatra</h3>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  The native of the Purvashada Nakshatra possesses great intelligence. These natives can be very impulsive and argumentative so that it is difficult for anyone to beat them in any debate. He has impressive convincing abilities and is bound to make a good salesman. He is always ready with advice, but never ready to take it from others. Another important point is that though he claims to be very courageous, he shies away from displaying or proving it. In fact, he is really not so courageous. However, if pushed to the limits by circumstances, he does act purposefully and the little courage that he does possess will get manifested. He does not take any decisions on his own, but if provoked by someone to dare to make a decision, he will take it without thinking about the pros and cons, which more often than not harm him.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>
                  The native of the Purvashada Nakshatra is particularly suited to be a doctor, though he can excel in any field. He should avoid doing business unless he has people whom he can trust in the higher echelons of the hierarchy. He will be very interested in occult philosophy and exoticism. Till the age of 32, he will be unsettled, but will steadily make progress in his career until the age of 50.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility male</h4>
                  The native of the Purvashada Nakshatra rarely benefits from his parents. But he will surely benefit from his siblings. He is likely to spend most of his life overseas. This native is likely to enjoy his conjugal life, though he may have a late marriage. He will lean more towards his in-laws than his parents. Even so, it has been observed that there will be some friction with his wife on and off. His children will be very talented and will bring great glory to the family.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Health male</h4>
                  The health of the male native of the Purvashada Nakshatra will mostly look good, but from inside he may not feel very healthy and something or the other will keep bothering him. Later in life, he may contract an incurable disease. However, he will not let his health affect his performance in his profession.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics female</h4>
                  The female native of the Purvashada Nakshatra is intelligent, energetic, and very enthusiastic. These traits make her very ambitious and get her on the top position in her chosen field. She performs well even during adverse circumstances, as she is determined to overcome any adversity. She is outspoken and does not bother whether her words hurt others or not. A negative tendency she has is that she makes promises too often, and mostly they remain unfulfilled.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession female</h4>

                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility female</h4>
                  The female native of the Purvashada Nakshatra makes for a good housewife. As she ages, her love for her husband deepens, which leads in turn to even more happiness. However, she will not benefit much from her children.
                  <br>
                  <h4> Health female</h4>
                  The health of this native will mostly be good, but minor ailments will keep bothering her. She is also likely to have problems with her uterus and thighs.
                  <br>
